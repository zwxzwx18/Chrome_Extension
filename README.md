Chrome_Extension
================
It can recognize line, L, triangle and rectangular. I created canvas on websites html and sampled the users mouse movement for recognition. I use simple algorithm to recognize different shapes and it performs really well. I was considering using the SVM or other method from CV to improve the program. However, the limitation of library we have and performance we need, I gave up this idea. 

After you press the middle button of your mouse and make movement, you should click the small icon and click the button “find word” in pop up html. I did not activate the gesture short key directly because it is easier for me to debug and improve my program. After you click that button, you will see the results of your gesture recognition. This is better for me to debug and I am still considering adding new features to this extension.

The gesture’s meaning is listed as followed:
Line: refresh the website
L: Go back
Triangle: Go forward
Rectangular: Have not defined yet

Thanks ^_^
